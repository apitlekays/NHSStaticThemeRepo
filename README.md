A static web template prepared for the project. This template will be converted into a custom Wordpress theme. The site utilises **Zurb Foundation 5** framework, and **Bower** as its file dependency management system. If you want to duplicate this project on your local machine, you have to setup several things to make the template function properly on your local machine.

To set up this project onto your local machine, follow this guide:

* install Bower globally 
`npm install -g bower`
